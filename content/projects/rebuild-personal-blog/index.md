## Introduction
Reading, learning and growing by the words of other people in the world is one of my main activities.
Though, giving back some of my own stories, learnings and discoveries wasn't an option to me until recently.
So, the idea to build, maintain and fill an own blog was born.

Nowadays there are multiple options to create a blog - to create content.
Static site generators are used more and more, opposite to traditional content management systems (CMS).
Also, there are many headless CMS around, which enables one to create content for multiple, maybe changing,
consuming systems - the frontend.

## Current Status
- Complete re-setup of GatsbyJS
- integration of proper markdown file handling
- many useful GatsbyJS plugins

## Setup, Problems & Learnings
Coming soon!
