## Introduction
Beginning with the winter, still constrained by the pandemic, I wanted to invest in an home server,
which should serve as base for learning network basics, docker basics and more experience with Linux in general.

I've chosen the Raspberry Pi 4 as an inexpensive opportunity to pursue those learning aspects stated above.
Apart the RPi, only a monitor and SD-Card reader was needed, to initially setup and further operate the device
via SSH - a simple and great terminal experience, in opposite to the general UI work I do at work and at home.

## Current Status
- Raspbian OS 64-bit
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Traefik Reverse Proxy
- Authelia Authentication
- Portainer
- Homer Dashboard
- Prometheus & Grafana Monitoring

## Setup, Problems & Learnings
Coming soon!
